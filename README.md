### <a name="game-rules"></a> Game Rules
1.  THIS GAME IS PLAYED WITH TWO PLAYERS IN ROUNDS
2.  ON PLAYER TURNS,
    * PLAYER ROLLS DICE
    * IF THEY ROLL A 1, TURN IS OVER, SCORE IS RESET AND NEXT PLAYER TURN BEGINS
    * IF PLAYER ROLLS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A 1, EACH ROLL WILL BE RECORDED TO THEIR CURRENT SCORE
    * PLAYER CAN ROLL DICE AS MANY TIMES AS THEY DESIRE PROVIDED THEY DO NOT ROLL A 1 ON ANY TURN THEY TAKE FOR A ROUND
    * IF A PLAYER HAS NOT ROLLED A 1, BUT WOULD LIKE TO CONCLUDE THEIR TURN AND SAVE THEIR POINTS, THEY CAN HOLD THEIR CURRENT SCORE           WHILE PASSING ROUND TO NEXT PLAYER
    * IF A PLAYER ROLLS TWO 6'S IN A ROW, THEY LOSE ALL THEIR GAME POINTS AND THEIR TURN IS ENDED
3.  PLAYERS CAN SET THE WINNING SCORE.  WHOEVER REACHES THIS SCORE FIRST, WINS THE GAME!
